                <p>Hayden J. Weal has directed two feature films, a TV series and edited over five features. He spent years on major sets, doubling for Martin Freeman in <em>The Hobbit</em> and later Daniel Radcliffe in <em>Guns Akimbo</em>.</p>

                <p>His debut feature <em>Chronesthesia</em> — a zero-budget time travel rom-com — premiered to sold-out screenings at the New Zealand International Film Festival before playing in Austin and Shanghai, where it was nominated in the 100 Flowers competition. The film drew acclaim for its honest portrayal of mental health, and Hayden still hears from people it touched.</p>

                <p>In 2018, he co-wrote and directed <em>DEAD</em>, which recouped its budget and found cult status among comedy-horror fans. In 2024, he made <em>Camp Be Better</em>, a six-episode limited TV series for TVNZ, a wildly ambitious summer-camp comedy with a big ensemble cast.</p>

                <p>Since moving to the UK, he directed YouTube juggernauts Beta Squad (10M+ subs), wrangling 40 kids and five cameras, and is developing a slate of four projects.</p>

                <p>His inspirations include Working Title, Baby Cow, and early Pegg & Wright. He's less drawn to work that's cynical, joyless, or tries too hard to be cool. He prefers democratic sets over dictatorships. For Hayden, the sweet spot is energetic comedies with heart.</p>
