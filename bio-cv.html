            <div class="bio-text">
                <p>Hayden J. Weal is a New Zealand-born filmmaker, now based in the UK, with a knack for wildly ambitious projects that are character-driven, hilarious, and heartfelt. Over the past fifteen years, he's written and directed two feature films, a TV series, numerous shorts, and has worked on major productions as an editor.</p>

                <p>He became well known for his 48HOURS Filmmaking Competition films, winning the Peter Jackson Wildcard multiple times, Best Music, and Wellington overall. He also spent years on major sets, doubling for Martin Freeman in <em>The Hobbit</em> and later Daniel Radcliffe in <em>Guns Akimbo</em>.</p>

                <p>His debut feature <em>Chronesthesia</em> — a zero-budget time travel rom-com shot on weekends with friend Simeon Duncombe — became a breakout hit. It premiered to sold-out screenings at the 2016 New Zealand International Film Festival, before playing Austin and Shanghai, where it was nominated in the 100 Flowers competition. The film drew acclaim for its honest portrayal of mental health, and Hayden still hears from people it touched.</p>

                <p>In 2018, he co-wrote and directed <em>DEAD</em>, a buddy-cop ghost comedy starring popular Kiwi comic Tom Sainsbury and Jennifer Ward-Lealand, one of New Zealand's most celebrated actors. <em>DEAD</em> recouped its budget and found cult status among comedy-horror fans. It also led to Hayden starring in Sainsbury's directorial debut, the psychological thriller <em>Loop Track</em>. In 2024, he made <em>Camp Be Better</em>, his first TV series for TVNZ, a wildly ambitious summer-camp comedy with a big ensemble cast and, for the first time, a decent-sized budget.</p>

                <p>Since 2021, he's worked alongside editor Luke Haigh (<em>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</em>) as First Assistant Editor, Associate Editor, and Editor. Recently, he began directing UK-based work, including a chaotic, multi-cam shoot with YouTube juggernauts Beta Squad (10M+ subs), wrangling 40 kids and five cameras without losing his mind or his timing.</p>

                <p>Hayden's collaborators describe him as sharp, grounded, and intensely collaborative. He solves problems instinctively, trusts people to do their best work, and creates the kind of set people want to come back to.</p>

                <p>He loves films that are smart, funny, and full of heart (think Working Title, Baby Cow, or early Pegg & Wright) with a soft spot for stories that make you laugh <em>and</em> feel something. He's currently developing a slate of projects in that vein: character-led stories with wit and charm. He's less drawn to work that's cynical, joyless, or takes itself too seriously. For Hayden, the sweet spot is energetic comedy with heart.</p>
