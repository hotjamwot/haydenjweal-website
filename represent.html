            While making films and working as an editor, I've been pursuing another passion: writing novels under the pen name Emerson Black. I love books and writing, so during Covid I decided to self-publish. I'd written three full-length novels before and hadn't published them, but after writing the <em>Seen in Silverbridge</em> series, I felt like it was time to get a professional editor, cover designer, and put some books out into the world. I continue to write books, spending two hours every morning before my workday starts on the next one.
